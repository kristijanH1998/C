The image below shows a 2D map of a school hallway. An agent (robot) has to come from its starting position (starting state),
(depicted with an orange triangle at the top left) to the destination classroom whose entrance is depicted with a blue 
circle. The interior of that classroom is essentially a goal state. In order to do that, the agent has to come to the 
entrance position in front of that classroom and enter it. Entrance position for each classroom is marked with a green circle. 
Classrooms start with letters from "A" to "E", "R" is the restroom, and offices start with "O". 

The set of states: all positions on a two-dimensional map of the hallway (but not beyond the bordering walls), and the 
interiors of all classrooms, offices and the restroom. Interior of each room is considered to be a single position 
(single state).

Start state: starting position marked with an orange triangle

Goal state: inside the classroom whose entrance is marked with a blue circle

Set of valid actions: moving up, down, left or right (north, south, west, or east) until a border (a wall) is reached. 
An agent cannot move past the wall, so depending on which wall is being faced by the agent, one or two movement directions
may be impossible. An agent can always move in at least two directions, except for when it is inside a room. 

The state space is a typical two-dimensional space where an agent can move freely as long as it is within the hallway. I 
imagine a specific signal an agent would receive once it comes to each room's entrance, telling it which room it is facing
at the moment. That way it can decide if it wants to enter that room or move somewhere else.
